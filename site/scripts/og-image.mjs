// The social card. An og:image pointing at an SVG is an empty rectangle on every platform
// that renders a card, so this rasterises the card to dist/og.png at 1200x630 on every
// build — and the card is regenerated whenever the mark or the copy on it changes.
//
// The card is a template, not a finished drawing. Its mark is spliced in from
// public/logo.svg at build time rather than pasted into the file, because a card carrying
// its own copy of the artwork is a card that goes stale the next time the artwork changes.
// The template lives here and not in public/ for the same reason: it is an input to this
// script, and nothing should ever link it.
//
// And the status pill is measured, not typed. The card asks for DejaVu and takes whatever
// the build machine has, so the same markup rasterises at one width on a runner that ships
// DejaVu and another on a workstation that falls back to something condensed. A pill
// hand-fitted to one of those overflows on the other. resvg measures the text here and the
// pill is drawn round the answer, so it fits whatever font resolves and survives the copy
// being reworded.

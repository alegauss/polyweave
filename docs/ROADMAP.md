# Roadmap (active backlog)

## Block A — What a tool call costs the turn

## Block B — Seeing the result cheaply

## Block C — The asset compiler

## Block D — Fetching from a paid service without surprise

## Block E — One world with the engine

## Block F — Motion

## Block G — Geometry as a declaration

## Block H — Proof on a real game

- 📋 **PW57** (deps: PW53 ⏸) **every Cottony look gate restates its own floor, so no asset has a bar a search can aim at** — Five check scripts measure after the render is spent, which is a verdict and never a target, and a threshold moved in one of them is invisible to the rest. → §PW57
- 📋 **PW59** (deps: PW53 ⏸, PW54 ✅, PW55 ✅, PW56 ⏳, PW57, PW58 ✅) **nothing says how much of Cottony still does its own version of what the plugin does** — Adoption is asserted per asset, so a hand-rolled rig, gate or runner can come back without anything failing, and 100% stays an opinion. → §PW59
- ⏳ **PW56** (deps: PW57) **twelve GDScript runners in Cottony each start Godot their own way, and a settings mismatch is silent** — The seven perf scripts started by hand have no driver, and five of them are gates whose verdict shape is §PW57's question. → §PW56

## Block I — Voxel models from a declaration

## Block J — A bar a person sets once

## Block K — Reached without reading the source

## Block L — What a run leaves as evidence

## Block M — What a game needs beyond the look

## Block N — Pictures held to a canon

- 📋 **PW178** (deps: PW163 ✅) **a picture is bought only synchronously, so each call holds a connection open until it is drawn** — The service takes the same request asynchronously and answers with an id to poll, which is also the task id the synchronous answer lacks. → §PW178
- 📋 **PW179** (deps: PW163 ✅, PW164 ✅) **a picture paid for whose download then fails is charged to no ceiling, so the next spend is judged too high** — The ledger is written only once the asset is on disk, and a picture service reports no balance to reveal the spend afterwards. → §PW179
- 📋 **PW180** (deps: PW166 ✅) **no canon picture is ever sent as a style reference, so a family's look reaches the service only as words** — A reference picture holds line weight and proportion that no palette or style block states, and the canon already holds the approved ones. → §PW180
- 📋 **PW181** (deps: PW170 ✅) **an approved picture cannot be reframed to another aspect ratio, so an icon and a banner of it are two separate pictures** — A reframe keeps everything the parent held and adds only a border, which is the easiest variation to hold to what it must not change. → §PW181

## Block O — A person sees and answers

- 📋 **PW173** (deps: PW172 ✅) **an answer given on the page reaches the agent only when the person says so again in chat** — A session that offered five families should resume on the first answer, from what was said, without re-reading the ledger to find out. → §PW173
- 📋 **PW174** (deps: PW173) **a person can say what is wrong with a picture only in words, so where it is wrong is the agent's guess** — An edit bounded by a guessed region redraws what the person liked, and a mark drawn over the picture is the region they meant. → §PW174
- 📋 **PW175** (deps: PW172 ✅, PW167 ✅) **a person sees the pictures the agent kept and never the ones it refused, so a wrong refusal is invisible** — The drift check makes the agent a filter nobody audits, and a bar set too tight costs good work in silence unless the refused are shown. → §PW175
- 📋 **PW176** (deps: PW172 ✅) **two versions of an asset are compared side by side, where a few ΔE of drift or a grown silhouette goes unseen** — Eyes compare a difference well only when both are in one place, so a slider, an onion skin and a difference map show what side by side hides. → §PW176
- 📋 **PW177** (deps: PW172 ✅, PW166 ✅) **the canon is a folder of files, so what a family is meant to look like is never seen whole** — A canon that quietly became two styles is found only by opening every file, and only a person's click should ever change what it holds. → §PW177

## Done when — PW36

- **Every piece of Cottony's pipeline runs on the plugin, with no fork** The
  script-built tray, the fetched prop in drawn cloth, the inflated cushion, the rig, the
  paid service and the four engine captures each pass the check the existing pipeline
  passes, against a before-side baseline recorded before that piece moved. A piece left
  behind is named, with what it needed.

## Done when — PW56

- **Every script that starts Godot here does it one way, and says what applied** Five of
  twelve are done: the four captures and cascade.gd go through engine and capture, and a
  mismatch fails the run. Left are the seven under tools/perf/ that have no driver, and
  run_tests.py, which is a third copy of the lookup and is PW70.

## Done when — PW77

- **Each of the five props has an acceptance spec a person agreed to**
  docs/design/accept/scenery_<name>.accept.toml exists for bush, tree, flower and yarn
  as it does for the mushroom, and the shipped sprite passes each.
- **One searched rig passes all five props and they bake through it** bake_model.py no
  longer renders the five, and polyweave.loop.json holds an after run for map_props with
  a person's verdict.
- **The props' before side is recorded ahead of the port** Cottony's polyweave.loop.json
  holds a before run for map_props at 2153a09, from a re-bake that reproduces the
  committed sprites.

## Done when — PW78

- **Both trays land where the game puts them, from the game's numbers** Cottony's
  tools/art/frame_trays.py exits 0: the board's silhouette matches the shipped sprite to
  the pixel and the booster tray stands within 1 px of its drawing's body.
- **The trays bake through the plugin with a look a person accepted** bake_model.py no
  longer renders board_tray or booster_tray, and polyweave.loop.json holds a before and
  an after run for the trays with a person's verdict.

## Done when — PW79

- **Each mark has a spec that says what its type must read as** docs/design/accept/
  holds a spec for viglet_games_badge, cottony_wordmark and cottony_logo that a person
  agreed to, and the shipped sprites pass it.
- **The marks bake through the plugin and a person judged them** bake_model.py no longer
  renders the three marks, and polyweave.loop.json holds an after run for brand_marks
  beside the before run at 53a9610.

## Done when — PW80

- **The fetched boosters come in from their drawings, textured** Ingested against
  booster_hammer.drawn.png and booster_wand.drawn.png, both keep their texture and the
  hammer's lean is found within a degree of the 22 found by hand.
- **The boosters bake through the plugin and a person judged them** bake_model.py no
  longer renders the three boosters, and polyweave.loop.json holds an after run for
  boosters beside the before run at ef16b28.

## Done when — PW81

- **The five earlier families have baked through the plugin first** PW76 to PW80 are
  shipped whole, each with a person's verdict on its after side, so this family starts
  from a rig and a search that have held elsewhere.
- **The five bake through the plugin or stay hand-tuned by decision** Either
  bake_model.py no longer renders the friends and the mascot and a person judged them,
  or a person decided they stay, and polyweave.loop.json says which.

## Done when — Block N

- **Two games keep two canons with no style compiled in** Cottony and Spinhole each
  declare `[style]` in their own polyweave.toml and generate against it, and a grep of
  src/polyweave finds neither project's palette, skeleton or path.
- **A mesh bought from a picture had its silhouette passed on the picture** For a real
  Cottony asset, the ledger holds the picture's entry and its shape check before the
  mesh's entry, and the mesh's provenance names that picture as its reference by digest.

## Done when — Block O

- **A real sitting is answered on the page and resumed without a chat message** For a
  Cottony family, a person answers on the review page, the ledger holds that verdict
  through judge alone, and the agent's next candidate follows from verdict.answers with
  no chat message in between.

## Non-goals

- **A graphical editor** The caller here is an agent in a terminal, so a surface only a
  person can operate is one the agent cannot use. A local page where a person looks and
  answers is not an editor: it edits nothing, and its one write is the verdict call an
  agent would make.
- **Replacing Blender, Godot or the generative service** Those three already do the
  work; what is missing is the loop around them, so this orchestrates and measures and
  never re-implements a renderer, an engine or a mesh generator.
- **Spending money on the agent's own judgement** A fetch draws on a real balance, so
  the ceiling is a person's to set and the plugin's job is to make a spend bounded and
  visible, never to decide one is worth it.
- **One project's palette, rig or paths compiled in** Cottony is the first consumer and
  not the specification, so anything it needs that a second project would not is
  configuration, and a default that cannot be overridden is a defect.
- **A hosted service or an account to sign into** Everything runs on the developer's
  machine against files in their own repository, because a plugin that needs an account
  is one that fails on the day the account does.
- **An agent accepting or rejecting its own look** A look is what a person agreed to, so
  an agent that can write the verdict on its own run turns the one check the loop cannot
  automate into one more number it tunes.

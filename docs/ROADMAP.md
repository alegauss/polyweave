# Roadmap (active backlog)

## Block A — What a tool call costs the turn

## Block B — Seeing the result cheaply

## Block C — The asset compiler

## Block D — Fetching from a paid service without surprise

## Block E — One world with the engine

- 📋 **PW273** (deps: —) **capture.movie asked at a size records at the project's window size, and is refused after as though the script erred** — Movie Maker ignores --resolution, so every shot of a game whose window differs from the size asked fails after the whole run. → §PW273

## Block F — Motion

- 📋 **PW272** (deps: —) **no measure says how well a target stands out from what lies behind it, so a shot's legibility is scripted by hand** — A shooter lives or dies on whether a hostile shot reads over a lit background, and that is a number a spec should hold. → §PW272

## Block G — Geometry as a declaration

## Block H — Proof on a real game

- 📋 **PW57** (deps: PW53 ⏸) **every Cottony look gate restates its own floor, so no asset has a bar a search can aim at** — Five check scripts measure after the render is spent, which is a verdict and never a target, and a threshold moved in one of them is invisible to the rest. → §PW57
- 📋 **PW59** (deps: PW53 ⏸, PW54 ✅, PW55 ✅, PW56 ⏳, PW57, PW58 ✅) **nothing says how much of Cottony still does its own version of what the plugin does** — Adoption is asserted per asset, so a hand-rolled rig, gate or runner can come back without anything failing, and 100% stays an opinion. → §PW59
- ⏳ **PW56** (deps: PW57) **twelve GDScript runners in Cottony each start Godot their own way, and a settings mismatch is silent** — The seven perf scripts started by hand have no driver, and five of them are gates whose verdict shape is §PW57's question. → §PW56
- 📋 **PW258** (deps: PW56 ⏳) **what a change costs a frame is found only by stashing, re-importing and timing both sides by hand** — A design that must hold the frame rate needs that number, and a recorded table goes stale the day other work lands. → §PW258

## Block I — Voxel models from a declaration

- 📋 **PW274** (deps: —) **a cube and a plate over the same box fill different cells where a face falls on a cell centre** — One box declared as two ops gives two models, so a region straddles or not by which op drew it. → §PW274

## Block J — A bar a person sets once

## Block K — Reached without reading the source

## Block L — What a run leaves as evidence

## Block M — What a game needs beyond the look

- 📋 **PW275** (deps: —) **store.capsules reads only a raster logo, so a wordmark kept as SVG has to be exported by hand at a guessed size** — Brand marks are kept as vectors, and a stroke measured on a scaled-down export is the export's, not the capsule's. → §PW275

## Block N — Pictures held to a canon

## Block O — A person sees and answers

## Block P — Music and sound a game can ship

## Block Q — Words held to the world

## Block R — Levels measured before a person plays them

- 📋 **PW202** (deps: PW201 ⏸) **A game's own headless play of a level has no way to report what it measured** — Only the game can play its own rules, so polyweave needs a contract for what the game's probe prints, not a simulator of its own. → §PW202
- 📋 **PW203** (deps: PW201 ⏸) **A level declared as data cannot reach the engine without each game's own converter** — Cottony writes JSON from a curve and Starship hand-edits .tres waves, so neither level is validated, linked to the world or recorded before it lands. → §PW203
- 📋 **PW204** (deps: PW202, PW203) **A level's difficulty has no bar a search can aim at, and a level set has no curve to hold** — Cottony's curve constants were set by feel and never measured, so a level can be unwinnable or trivial and nothing fails. → §PW204
- 📋 **PW205** (deps: PW202, PW203) **A shooter's waves have no measure of threat, so the level contract is proven on one genre only** — A contract only Cottony's match-3 has exercised may still assume a board, and Starship's check_phase_waves counts enemies without asking how many arrive at once. → §PW205
- 📋 **PW206** (deps: PW204, PW205) **Cottony's levels are still tuned by a curve nobody measured** — The block is proven only when its first consumer's shipped levels are declared, compiled, probed and accepted here, and make_levels.py has nothing left to do. → §PW206

## Block S — Playing the game, not only rendering it

- 📋 **PW270** (deps: —) **a kept flow names nodes by Godot's generated names, so any node added before them breaks it** — Cottony names few of its nodes, so its flows click and expect at @Node2D@14-style paths that a reordering of its tree renumbers. → §PW270
- 📋 **PW271** (deps: —) **a flow that needs many moves costs thousands of calls, so losing a later Cottony level was never kept** — Each command-line call is a process of its own and a fresh save unlocks only level 1, so after two hours and ten sessions the explorer gave up. → §PW271

## Block T — Adopting polyweave in a project

## Done when — PW36

- **Every piece of Cottony's pipeline runs on the plugin, with no fork** The
  script-built tray, the fetched prop in drawn cloth, the inflated cushion, the rig, the
  paid service and the four engine captures each pass the check the existing pipeline
  passes, against a before-side baseline recorded before that piece moved. A piece left
  behind is named, with what it needed.

## Done when — PW56

- **Every script that starts Godot here does it one way, and says what applied** Five of
  twelve are done: the four captures and cascade.gd go through engine and capture, and a
  mismatch fails the run. Left are the seven under tools/perf/ that have no driver, and
  run_tests.py, which is a third copy of the lookup and is PW70.

## Done when — PW77

- **Each of the five props has an acceptance spec a person agreed to**
  docs/design/accept/scenery_<name>.accept.toml exists for bush, tree, flower and yarn
  as it does for the mushroom, and the shipped sprite passes each.
- **One searched rig passes all five props and they bake through it** bake_model.py no
  longer renders the five, and polyweave.loop.json holds an after run for map_props with
  a person's verdict.
- **The props' before side is recorded ahead of the port** Cottony's polyweave.loop.json
  holds a before run for map_props at 2153a09, from a re-bake that reproduces the
  committed sprites.

## Done when — PW78

- **Both trays land where the game puts them, from the game's numbers** Cottony's
  tools/art/frame_trays.py exits 0: the board's silhouette matches the shipped sprite to
  the pixel and the booster tray stands within 1 px of its drawing's body.
- **The trays bake through the plugin with a look a person accepted** bake_model.py no
  longer renders board_tray or booster_tray, and polyweave.loop.json holds a before and
  an after run for the trays with a person's verdict.

## Done when — PW79

- **Each mark has a spec that says what its type must read as** docs/design/accept/
  holds a spec for viglet_games_badge, cottony_wordmark and cottony_logo that a person
  agreed to, and the shipped sprites pass it.
- **The marks bake through the plugin and a person judged them** bake_model.py no longer
  renders the three marks, and polyweave.loop.json holds an after run for brand_marks
  beside the before run at 53a9610.

## Done when — PW80

- **The fetched boosters come in from their drawings, textured** Ingested against
  booster_hammer.drawn.png and booster_wand.drawn.png, both keep their texture and the
  hammer's lean is found within a degree of the 22 found by hand.
- **The boosters bake through the plugin and a person judged them** bake_model.py no
  longer renders the three boosters, and polyweave.loop.json holds an after run for
  boosters beside the before run at ef16b28.

## Done when — PW81

- **The five earlier families have baked through the plugin first** PW76 to PW80 are
  shipped whole, each with a person's verdict on its after side, so this family starts
  from a rig and a search that have held elsewhere.
- **The five bake through the plugin or stay hand-tuned by decision** Either
  bake_model.py no longer renders the friends and the mascot and a person judged them,
  or a person decided they stay, and polyweave.loop.json says which.

## Done when — Block N

- **Two games keep two canons with no style compiled in** Cottony and Spinhole each
  declare `[style]` in their own polyweave.toml and generate against it, and a grep of
  src/polyweave finds neither project's palette, skeleton or path.
- **A mesh bought from a picture had its silhouette passed on the picture** For a real
  Cottony asset, the ledger holds the picture's entry and its shape check before the
  mesh's entry, and the mesh's provenance names that picture as its reference by digest.

## Done when — Block O

- **A real sitting is answered on the page and resumed without a chat message** For a
  Cottony family, a person answers on the review page, the ledger holds that verdict
  through judge alone, and the agent's next candidate follows from verdict.answers with
  no chat message in between.

## Done when — PW200

- **Starship's crew lines are judged into a lines canon** A person reads the crew lines
  through words.sheet and records verdicts; words.check against Starship then reports
  the approved lines as the canon rather than 453 unjudged rows.
- **A Lattice or Foreman picture is bought with entity=** The next enemy or Foreman
  picture Starship buys goes through picture.buy with entity=, and its provenance
  sidecar names the entity from starship.world.toml.

## Done when — PW259

- **Starship's seven trails are built through vfx.build** Starship's seven trails are
  seven declarations built and accepted through polyweave, and the game instances the
  scenes built instead of reading its own trail Resources.

## Non-goals

- **A graphical editor** The caller here is an agent in a terminal, so a surface only a
  person can operate is one the agent cannot use. A local page where a person looks and
  answers is not an editor: it edits nothing, and its one write is the verdict call an
  agent would make.
- **Replacing Blender, Godot or the generative service** Those three already do the
  work; what is missing is the loop around them, so this orchestrates and measures and
  never re-implements a renderer, an engine or a mesh generator.
- **Spending money on the agent's own judgement** A fetch draws on a real balance, so
  the ceiling is a person's to set and the plugin's job is to make a spend bounded and
  visible, never to decide one is worth it.
- **One project's palette, rig or paths compiled in** Cottony is the first consumer and
  not the specification, so anything it needs that a second project would not is
  configuration, and a default that cannot be overridden is a defect.
- **A hosted service or an account to sign into** Everything runs on the developer's
  machine against files in their own repository, because a plugin that needs an account
  is one that fails on the day the account does.
- **An agent accepting or rejecting its own look** A look, a sound, a line a character
  says and how hard a level feels are each what a person agreed to, so an agent that can
  write the verdict on its own run turns the one check the loop cannot automate into one
  more number it tunes.
- **One genre's level format built in** A match-3 level is three numbers and a shooter's
  is a spawn timeline, so polyweave checks, compiles and measures a level through what
  the project declares, and a schema that assumes a genre fails the next game; PW205
  exists to catch that.
- **Writing a game's story for it** A world is a person's authorship, so polyweave holds
  what the game shows to the world a person declared and routes a line's tone to their
  verdict, and never invents the canon it then checks against.
